## What is event sourcing

Event sourcing is a development pattern to solve audit problems and make our application more easily maintainable. It is described as:

> **A way to capture all changes to an application state as a sequence of events.**

There's not much jabber about it right now, however this pattern first emerged in one of Martin Fowler's [articles](https://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventSourcing.html) in 2005, for some reason it's been forgotten ever since.

I'm not describing it all here, however I have a series of related material (in portuguese) so you can study it for yourself.

## Running the application

This app uses Docker Compose as runner, it'll build and set all your containers, you just need to run `docker-compose up` in the root directory.

## Challenge!

This app version has some intentional "errors" and/or misleading designs in order to incentivate students to improve it.

### How do I improve?

Our branches are named `master` which is v1, we have `v2` with some additional improvements. If you want to make even more improvements, clone the project and go to the `v2` branch. Then do your thing and submit a PR for approval.

**DO NOT FORGET TO ADD WHAT YOU HAVE CHANGED IN THE [BACKEND CHANGELOG](./backend/CHANGELOG.md) OR [FRONTEND CHANGELOG](./frontend/CHANGELOG.md) FILES IN ORDER TO LET PEOPLE KNOW WHAT HAS BEEN DONE**

> PR's without changelogs will not be approved
